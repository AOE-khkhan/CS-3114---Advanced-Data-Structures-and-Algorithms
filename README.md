## Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms 
Capstone programming class for Virginia Tech


#### *Assignment 1:*
  Designed a file processor that reads in commands to store data in a Hash table that is controlled by a memory pool. Items stored in hash   table are objects known as Handles, which hold an int value that is equal to its location in the memory pool.


#### *Assignment 2:*
  Designed a 2-3+ tree to work with Assignment 1. The new tree allows for range query's on specific data that is inserted into the Hash     Table.
  
  
#### *Assignment 3:*
  Designed a Buffer Pool to read and write binary data from file on disk. Objective was to take a non-sorted file and sort it using         Quicksort Algorithm given a certain stress-test time limit.
  
  
#### *Assignment 4:*
  Combined Assignment 3 and Assignment 1 to store data in Hash table controlled by disk buffers instead of memory pool. Designed graph       object to keep track of components and diameters of the largest connected component.
